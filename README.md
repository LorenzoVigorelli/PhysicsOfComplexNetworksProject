# Physics of Complex Networks â€“ Project Repository

This repository contains the theoretical and data projects developed for the course *Physics of Complex Networks: Structure and Dynamics* lectured by Prof. Manlio De Domenico (University of Padova, 2024).

It includes code, outputs, and reports for three different tasks:

## Task 34: Game Theory on Networks (Score: 0.4)
- **Topic**: Characterization and simulation of the Ultimatum Game on networks.  
- **Goal**: Investigate how fairness and the rejection of unfair proposals spread in a population, and how these mechanisms relate to the emergence of cooperation.  

## Task 38: K-core and K-clique Percolation (Score: 0.6)
- **Topic**: Analysis of percolation phenomena in local structures.  
- **Goal**: Characterize the behavior of the order parameter and simulate critical phenomena in k-clique percolation.  

## Task 44: Social Connectedness Index (Score: 1.0)
- **Topic**: Construction and analysis of networks based on the Social Connectedness Index (SCI), which measures the strength of relationships between pairs of geographical regions using data from Facebook active users.  
- **Goal**: Build and analyze networks at the NUTS3 (Europe) and GADM2 (global) regional levels.
