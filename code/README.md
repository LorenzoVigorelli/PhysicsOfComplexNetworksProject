# Code Documentation

This folder contains the scripts and outputs for the three tasks of the project.  
Each task has its own scripts and corresponding output directories.

---

## Task 34: Game Theory on Networks
- **sweep.py**: Python script that defines the Ultimatum Game and runs simulations on ER, BA and EMP networks. Parameters can be configured directly from the terminal using an argument parser.  
- **run_all_sweeps_with_emp.sh**: Shell script (generated with ChatGPT 5) to run `sweep.py` multiple times with different parameter combinations, making use of the parser.  
- **outputs_batch_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/**: Directory with plots and numerical results from the simulations.  

---

## Task 38: K-core and K-clique Percolation
- **perc1.py**: Python script to simulate percolation phenomena. Parameters can be configured directly inside the file.  
- **outputFinal/**: Directory with plots and numerical results from the percolation simulations.  

---

## Task 44: Social Connectedness Index (SCI)
- **script.py**: Python script that generates node and edge files, either per country or for the whole world (or selected regions). It requires input files located in the corresponding `data/` folder. The script has parameters for selecting regions and priorities among GADM regions. As additional output, it reports the coverage of each geographical region in SCI with respect to the NUTS, GADM and Counties datasets.  
- **analysis.py**: Python script that computes metrics and produces plots on subnetworks and global networks. Requires CSV or PKL files produced by `script.py`.  
- **edges_by_country/**: Directory containing edge files for each country.  
- **nodes_by_country/**: Directory containing node files for each country.  
- **node_list.csv**: Node file for all countries.  
- **outputs/**: Metrics and plots generated by `analysis.py`.  
- **exampleOutput.md**: Example of the intermediate output produced by `script.py` before building the final node and edge lists. This file was originally created in a Jupyter Notebook to explore and inspect the dataset.  

### Required Data Files for Task 44
The following files must be placed inside the `data/` folder of Task 44. They provide the geographical reference and boundary data needed by the scripts:

- **SCI mapping files**:  
  - `gadm1_nuts3_counties_levels.csv`: Mapping of GADM, NUTS3, and county levels.  
  - `gadm1_nuts3_counties-gadm1_nuts3_counties2021.tsv`: Extended mapping file (2021 version).  

- **GADM dataset** (Global Administrative Areas, version 4.1.0):  
  - `gadm_410.gpkg`: Geopackage with administrative boundaries.  

  **Note**: The GADM version used here (4.1.0) is not the one employed in the original SCI dataset (which was based on GADM 2.8). Some inconsistencies may therefore occur when matching SCI data with regions. Version 4.1.0 was chosen because the correct historical release (2.8) is no longer available.  

- **NUTS datasets** (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, Eurostat, 2016 release at 1:60M scale):  
  - `NUTS_RG_60M_2016_4326_LEVL_3.geojson`: GeoJSON with NUTS3 regions.  
  - `NUTS_RG_60M_2016_4326_LEVL_3.shp` (and associated files): Shapefile with NUTS3 boundaries.  
  - `NUTS_RG_BN_60M_2016.csv`: Boundary and naming information for NUTS regions.  

- **US County boundaries**:  
  - `us-county-boundaries.geojson`: GeoJSON with US county polygons.  

These datasets provide the spatial framework to correctly align SCI data with geographical regions (Europe: NUTS3, Global: GADM2, US: Counties).
